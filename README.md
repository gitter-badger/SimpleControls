## What is this?
This is my main repo for all Simple Control Xamarin Plugins that I have or will be publishing. 
These PCL plugins will allow you to add rich cross platform functionality to Xamarin, Xamarin.Forms and Windows Projects that use a PCLs or Shared Project.

# Current Plugins for Xamarin

Each plugin has a README with more information on what they contain.
* **[ImageDialogs](https://github.com/Johan-dutoit/SimpleControls/tree/master/ImageDialog)**: Popup dialogs with a title(optional) and an image.
